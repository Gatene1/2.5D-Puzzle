# 2.5D-Puzzle
Another class script. Nothing special, but there is some code I want to remember in there.

I guess this is the closest thing I have written to a post-mortem. This challenge was great. I was able to flex my programming muscles, which I haven't done in quite a while. Using my brain to dig deep into the problem, and figure out one way to solve the problem. That feeling of elation is a recipe for a good day/night's work. The biggest victory was not feeling ashamed of seeking help from unity docs or elsewhere. I've learned it is expected to do so.
